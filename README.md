# mofi

The app is under development (develop branch)

Mofi is a mobile application to track personal finances.
- It allows you to link with your bank to automate the transaction registration processes.
- Schedule recurring transactions.
- In-App notifications.
- In-App purchases.
- Detailed reports of your financial closings.
- It is modern and user friendly.

This is my side-project as a solution for several clients, an app focused on financial management for individuals as well as for small business. 
- I use Dart/Flutter, BLoC for business logic, Domain Driven Design architecture, MVVM and different third-party libraries. 
- Firebase for Google and Email Authentication, Firestore Database and FirebaseStorage to store and retrieve data from the cloud. 
- Asynchronous API calls from different providers to integrate with self solution, and use the JSON format for server communication. 
- Created large custom Widgets based on client needs, following best practices on code. 
- Tech stacks: Flutter, Dart, Google Firebase, Networking, APIs, JSON.
